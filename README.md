The use of repetition with using the CRUD lead to my code being very easily readable and maintainable. I went back a number of times throughout the final assignments and altered and improved it to make sure it was effectively working and not holding back
the future work that it was needed for. The concrete base of the CRUD allowed for the functionality of the future assignments to work. 
I approach problems through way of breaking them down into sections trying to make sure I have the parts working before I worry about the whole of the project.
Computer scientists allow for the quick and effective use of data that helps us all in the current age of technology. Without applications such as our dashboard we would never be able to use data to the extent we do and with such swiftness and ease.
